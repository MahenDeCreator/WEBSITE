  <h1 class="title">DELL Inc.</h1>

<body>
<p class="left">Dell /ˈdɛl/ is an American technology company that develops, sells, repairs, and supports 
computers and related products and services, and is owned by its parent company of Dell Technologies.Dell 
sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals,
 HDTVs, cameras, printers, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is known for how it 
 manages its supply chain and electronic commerce. This includes Dell selling directly to customers and delivering
 PCs that the customer wants.[6][5] Dell was a pure hardware vendor until 2009 when it acquired Perot Systems.
 Dell then entered the market for IT services. The company has expanded storage and networking systems, 
 now aiming to expand from offering computers only to delivering a range of technology for enterprise customers. 
Dell was a publicly-traded company (Nasdaq: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P
 500. It is the 3rd largest personal computer vendor as of January 2021.[9][10] Dell is ranked 31st on the Fortune 500
 list in 2022[11] up from 76th in 2021.It is also the sixth-largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to 
 Fortune magazine. It is the second-largest non-oil company in Texas.In 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology
 firm EMC Corporation. Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC sells data storage, information 
 security, virtualization, analytics, and cloud computing
 Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell 
plants in Austin, Texas, (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee, (opened in 1999), which were closed 
in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, opened in 2005 but ceased
 operations in November 2010.Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's US plants was transferred to 
 contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The Miami, Florida,
 facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers 
 (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas.Dell assembled computers for the EMEA market at the 
 Limerick facility in the Republic of Ireland, and once employed about 4,500 people in that country.
 Dell began manufacturing in Limerick in 1991 and went on to become Ireland's largest exporter of goods
 and its second-largest company and foreign investor. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would
 move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to Dell's new plant in the Polish city of Łódź by January 2010.
 European Union officials said they would investigate a €52.7million aid package the Polish government 
 used to attract Dell away from Ireland.[201] European Manufacturing Facility 1 (EMF1, opened in 1990) 
 and EMF3 form part of the Raheen Industrial Estate near Limerick</p>

<h2 class="title">Manufacturing</h2>
<p class="left">From its early beginnings, Dell operated as a pioneer in the "configure to order" approach to
 manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications. In contrast, most PC manufacturers
 in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.To minimize the delay between 
 purchase and delivery, Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers. This
 also allows for implementing a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing approach, which minimizes inventory costs. 
 Low inventory is another signature of the Dell business model—a critical consideration in an industry where
 components depreciate very rapidly.Dell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, 
 functional testing (including "burn-in"), and quality control. Throughout most of the company's history, 
 Dell manufactured desktop machines in-house and contracted out the manufacturing of base notebooks for 
 configuration in-house.Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell 
plants in Austin, Texas, (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee, (opened in 1999), which were closed

  <h1 class="title">Self-signed root certificate</h1>

<hr>
<p class="left">In November 2015, it emerged that several Dell computers had shipped with an 
identical pre-installed root certificate known as "eDellRoot".[211] This raised such security 
risks as attackers impersonating HTTPS-protected websites such as Google and Bank of America 
and malware being signed with the certificate to bypass Microsoft software filtering.[211] Dell 
apologized and offered a removal tool.</p>
 

  <h1 class="title">Dell Foundation Services</h1>

<hr>

<p class="left">Also in November 2015, a researcher discovered that customers with diagnostic
 program Dell Foundation Services could be digitally tracked using the unique service tag number
 assigned to them by the program.[213] This was possible even if a customer enabled private browsing 
 and deleted their browser cookies.[213] Ars Technica recommended that Dell customers uninstall the
 program until the issue was addressed</p>
