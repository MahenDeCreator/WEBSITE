 by a business (as of 2020) for 28 consecutive years.
 IBM was founded in 1911 in Endicott, New York, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording 
 Company (CTR) and was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New 
 York and has operations in over 170 countries.Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine
 (ATM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the
 SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe
 , exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 70s.</p>

<h2 class="title">Products and Services</h2>
<p class="left">IBM has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services. As of 2016, these 
 offerings fall into the categories of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, commerce, data and
 analytics, Internet of things (IoT),[108] IT infrastructure, mobile, digital workplace and cybersecurity.
 IBM Cloud includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service
 (PaaS) offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models. For instance, the IBM Bluemix PaaS 
 enables developers to quickly create complex websites on a pay-as-you-go model. IBM SoftLayer is a dedicated
 server, managed hosting and cloud computing provider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers 
 for more than 26,000 customers.[111] IBM also provides Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), using 
 cryptographic splitting to secure customer data</p>

<p class="left">IBM also hosts the industry-wide cloud computing and mobile technologies conference InterConnect
  each year.Hardware designed by IBM for these categories include IBM's Power microprocessors, which are employed 
  inside many console gaming systems, including Xbox 360,[114] PlayStation 3, and Nintendo's Wii U.[115][116] IBM 
  Secure Blue is encryption hardware that can be built into microprocessors,[117] and in 2014, the company 
  revealed TrueNorth, a neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuit and announced a $3 billion investment over the 
  following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100
  trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power.[118] In 2016, the company launched all-flash arrays 
  designed for small and midsized companies, which includes software for data compression, provisioning, and
  snapshots across various systems.IT outsourcing also represents a major service provided by IBM, with more 
  than 60 data centers worldwide. alphaWorks is IBM's source for emerging software technologies, and SPSS
  is a software package used for statistical analysis. IBM's Kenexa suite provides employment and retention 
  solutions[buzzword], and includes the BrassRing, an applicant tracking system used by thousands of companies 
  for recruiting.[121] IBM also owns The Weather Company, which provides weather forecasting and includes 
  weather.com and Weather Underground.Smarter Planet is an initiative that seeks to achieve economic growth,
  near-term efficiency, sustainable development, and societal progress,[123][124] targeting opportunities such
  as smart grids,[125] water management systems,[126] solutions to traffic congestion,[127] and greener building</p>
 

  <h1 class="title">Brand and Reputation</h1>

<hr>

<p class="left">IBM is nicknamed Big Blue in part due to its blue logo and color scheme,[150][151] and also
 partially since IBM once had a de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits.[150][152] The company
 logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current "8-bar" logo designed in 1972 by graphic
 designer Paul Rand.[153] It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not 
 render narrow (as opposed to tall) stripes well. Aside from the logo, IBM used Helvetica as a corporate 
 typeface for 50 years, until it was replaced in 2017 by the custom-designed IBM Plex.IBM has a valuable brand
 as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns.
 Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, 
  one of the four major championships in professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), 
  the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra
  High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).[154] As a result, IBM CEO Ginni
  Rometty became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club. IBM 
  is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian
  Open, and the French Open.[156] The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1960 to 2000,[157] and 
  the National Football League from 2003 to 2012.In 2012, IBM's brand was valued at $75.5 billion and ranked 
  by Interbrand as the third-best brand worldwide.[159] That same year, it was also ranked the top company 
  for leaders (Fortune), the number two green company in the U.S. (Newsweek),[160] the second-most respected 
  company (Barron's),[161] the fifth-most admired company (Fortune), the 18th-most innovative company 
  (Fast Company), and the number one in technology consulting and number two in outsourcing (Vault).
  In 2015, Forbes ranked IBM as the fifth-most valuable brand,[163] and for 2020, the Drucker Institute 
  named IBM the No. 3 best-managed company</p>
