<p class="left">The Hewlett-Packard Company, commonly shortened to Hewlett-Packard (/ˈhjuːlɪt ˈpækərd/  
HEW-lit PAK-ərd) or HP, was an American multinational information technology company headquartered  
inPalo Alto, California. HP developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components, as well as  
software and related services to consumers, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and large  
enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors. The company was  
founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in 1939, and initially 
produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue  
is now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling 
it the "Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'".The company won its first big contract in 1938 to provide 
test and measurement instruments for Walt Disney's production of the animated film Fantasia, 
which allowed Hewlett and Packard to formally establish the Hewlett-Packard Company on July 2, 1939.
The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products. 
HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when Lenovo 
moved ahead of HP.HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage,
 and networking hardware; designing software; and delivering services. Major product lines included 
 personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, 
 networking products, software, and a range of printers and other imaging products. The company
 directly marketed its products to households; small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises, 
 as well as via online distribution; consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers; software 
 partners; and major technology vendors. It also offered services and a consulting business for
 its products and partner products.In 1999, HP spun off its electronic and bio-analytical test 
 and measurement instruments business into Agilent Technologies; HP retained focus on its later 
 products, including computers and printers. It merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired 
 Electronic Data Systems in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4 billion that year 
 and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009.</p>

 full range of services to design, implement, and support IT infrastructure.HP's 
 Imaging and Printing Group (IPG) was described by the company in 2005 as "the leading
