<body>
<p class="left">Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics, 
software and online services headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is the largest 
technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in 2021) and as of May 2022, it is the world's 
second biggest company by market capitalization,[7] the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit 
sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology 
companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.

 in August 2020, and most recently $3 trillion in January 2022. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices 
 of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials
 sourcing. Nevertheless, the company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty, and is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.</p>

  <h1 class="title">Products</h1>

<hr>

<h2 class="title"> Macintosh</h2>
<p class="left">Macintosh, commonly known as Mac, is Apple's line of personal computers that use the company's proprietary
 macOS operating system. Personal computers were Apple's original business line, but as of the end of 2021 they account for 
 only about 10 percent of the company's revenue
 
Apple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display
, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.The company also develops several pieces of software that are included 
in the purchase price of a Mac, including the Safari web browser, the iMovie video editor, the GarageBand audio editor and
 the iWork productivity suite.Additionally, the company sells several professional software applications including the Final
 Cut Pro video editor, Motion for video animations, the Logic Pro audio editor, MainStage for live audio production, 
 and Compressor for media compression and encoding.</p>
 
<h2 class="title">Iphone</h2>
<p class="left">iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones that use the company's proprietary iOS operating system, derived from 
macOS's kernel. The first-generation iPhone was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, Apple
 has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates.The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen,
 which at the time of its introduction was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry. 
 The device has been credited with popularizing the smartphone and slate form factor, and with creating a large market for
 smartphone apps, or "app economy".
 
iOS is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android. The iPhone has generated 
large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded 
companies.[222] As of the end of 2021, the iPhone accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.</p>

<h2 class="title"> Ipad </h2>
<p class="left">iPad is Apple's line of tablet computers that use the company's proprietary iPadOS operating system, derived
 from macOS and iOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010.The iPad took the multi-touch user interface
 first introduced in the iPhone, and adapted it to a larger screen, it was marketed for interaction with multimedia formats
 including newspapers, books, photos, videos, music, documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps. Earlier generations
 of the iPad used the same iOS operating system as the company's smartphones before being split off to iPadOS in September 2019.
 
As of September 2020, Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[223][224][225]
 The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020,[226] and accounted for nine
 percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2021.[3]In recent years, Apple has started offering more powerful versions
 of the device, with the current iPad Pro using the same M1 Apple silicon as the company's high-end Macs and Laptops, along
 with a smaller version of the device called the iPad Mini, and an upgraded version called iPad Air.</p>
 
 
  <h1 class="title">Services</h1>

<hr>
<p class="left">Apple also offers a broad line of services that it earns revenue on, including advertising in the App Store 
and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services 
through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, a digital content services including Apple Books, 
Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.As of the end of 2021, services comprise about 
19% of the company's revenue.[3] Many of the services have been launched since 2019 when Apple announced it would be making
 a concerted effort to expand its service revenues</p>
 

  <h1 class="title">Privacy Stance</h1>

<hr>
<p class="left">Apple has a notable pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of
 its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[491][492][493] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014,
 the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time
 for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[494] With the popularity
 rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos
 on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[495]
 It also introduced "differential privacy", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual
 users anonymous, in a system that Wired described as "trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning
 as little as possible about any individual in it".[496] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate,
 and can actively opt-in or opt-out
 
With Apple's release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod
 touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, titled "App Tracking Transparency",
 received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing
 such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. Despite
 Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple
 released the update in mid-spring 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in 
 the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[498][499][500][501]However, Apple aids law enforcement
 in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices, and the company's commitment
 to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models,
 which don't have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.Prior to the release of iOS 15,
 Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users
 can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media
 destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement;
 if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed.</p>
